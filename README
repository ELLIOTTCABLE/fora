fora
====

[fora][1] (yes, it's all lowercase letters) is a self-hosted discussion forum
software, done *differently*

philosophy
----------

* no categories, completely dynamic tags and master tags
* no registration - every visitor is automatically assigned an account, and
they are automatically logged in to the correct account when visiting again
* no community authentication - every user is assumed to be trustworthy (no
passwords to log in, can edit anybody elses' posts, like a wiki - although
versions are kept)
* member trust built on self-sufficient ratings, not mere membership
